      <p> Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) grows up in Cornwall, in a house by the sea with his father James (Bill Nighy), mother Mary (Lindsay Duncan), absent-minded uncle Desmond
        (Richard Cordery), and free-spirited sister Katherine or "Kit Kat" (Lydia Wilson). At the age of 21, Tim learns from his father that the men of his
        family have the secret ability to travel back in time, to moments they have lived before. In order to time travel, they must be in a dark space, clench 
        their fists and visualize the memory they wish to travel back to. James discourages his son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it 
        to improve his love life..</p>
